## [Advanced Course on Neural Data Analysis (DL: 31 January)](https://portal.g-node.org/advanced-course-2017/doku.php)
*Juelich, Germany ~ March 26 - April 8 2017*

Techniques to record neuronal data from single neurons and population of neurons are rapidly improving. Meanwhile recordings are possible from hundreds of channels simultaneously while animals perform complex tasks. Thus also the analysis of such data becomes increasingly challenging. This advanced course aims at providing deeper insights in state-of-the-art questions in neuroscience, analysis approaches and how to formalize questions to neuronal data so they can be answered quantitatively.


## [Neural Systems & Behavior (DL: February 1, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/summer-courses/neural-systems-behavior/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Chicago, US ~ June 4 - July 31, 2017*

This course provides broad training in modern approaches to the study of neural mechanisms underlying behavior, perception, and cognition. Through a combination of lectures, exercises, and projects, students investigate neural systems at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels using state-of-the-art techniques. The eight weeks are divided into two-week cycles, providing participants with an in-depth familiarity with several different experimental model systems. In the first cycle, students study a simple invertebrate model system to develop general experimental skills in electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, and quantitative analysis of physiological and behavioral data. In subsequent cycles, students work on a series of different preparations, providing them with a breadth of knowledge in the field. The list of experimental model systems is updated year-to-year, but always includes a diverse array of vertebrate and invertebrate preparations, chosen to illustrate key concepts and novel techniques in the field. The goal of the course is to expose students to diverse approaches to the investigation of the neural basis of behavior.

## [Neurobiology (DL: February 1, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/neurobiology/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Chicago, US ~ June 2 - July 31, 2017*

A hallmark of this course is the extensive lab work done in close collaboration with expert faculty. The course is divided into three sections: Electrophysiology, Imaging, and Molecular Neurobiology. These are taught by separate groups of faculty, usually six in each section, and with many guest lecturers. Each section begins with specific training in core laboratory techniques; students then undertake one- to two-week directed or independent projects using the methods they have learned. Didactic lectures are combined with laboratory experience in order to establish a strong conceptual foundation for each section. A typical day has 3 hours of lecture and 10 hours of lab.

Electrophysiological methods focus on patch-clamp and sharp electrode recordings, performed on neurons in a variety of preparations, including tissue culture, brain slices, isolated squid synapses, rat cochlea, or whole fish. Optical methods include calcium imaging, confocal and 2-photon microscopy, videomicroscopy, and electron microscopy. Molecular techniques emphasize the use of forward and reverse genetics in diverse systems such as Drosophila, C. elegans, zebrafish, chick embryos, and primary cells in culture. The impact of genetic manipulations are assayed by real time PCR, laser microdissection, single cell PCR, in situ hybridization, and a variety of immunotechniques in addition to incorporating electrophysiological and imaging techniques.

The goal of the course is to emphasize the strengths of a multidisciplinary approach for studying the function of the nervous system at the cellular and molecular levels.

## [OIST Computational Neuroscience Course (DL: February 5, 2017)](https://groups.oist.jp/ocnc)
*Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan ~ June 26 - July 13, 2017*

The aim of the Okinawa Computational Neuroscience Course is to provide opportunities for young researchers with theoretical backgrounds to learn the latest advances in neuroscience, and for those with experimental backgrounds to have hands-on experience in computational modeling. 

OCNC will be a comprehensive three-week course covering single neurons, networks, and behaviors with ample time for student projects. The first week will focus exclusively on methods with hands-on tutorials during the afternoons, while the second and third weeks will have lectures by international experts. We invite those who are interested in integrating experimental and computational approaches at each level, as well as in bridging different levels of complexity.

## [Nengo (DL: February 15, 2017)](http://www.nengo.ca/summerschool)
*Waterloo University, Waterloo, Canada ~ June 4 - June 16, 2017*

This two-week school will teach participants how to use the Nengo simulation package to build state-of-the-art cognitive and neural models. Nengo has been used to build what is currently the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun, and provides users with a versatile and powerful environment for modelling cognitive and neural systems to run in simulation and on neuromorphic hardware. We welcome applications from all interested graduate students, research associates, postdocs, professors, and industry professionals. No specific training in the use of modelling software is required, but we encourage applications from active researchers with a relevant background in psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, robotics, neuromorphic engineering, or a related field.

The main goal of the summer school is to have participants learn to build state-of-the-art neural or cognitive models using Nengo. Participants are encouraged to bring their own ideas for projects, which may focus on testing hypotheses, modelling neural or cognitive data, implementing specific behavioural functions with neurons, expanding past models, or provide a proof-of-concept of various neural mechanisms. Projects can be focused on software, hardware, or a combination of both.


## [Computational Approaches to Memory and Plasticity (DL: March 12, 2016)](https://camp.ncbs.res.in/)

CAMP @ Bangalore (Computational Approaches to Memory and Plasticity at NCBS, Bangalore) is a 16-day summer school on the theory and simulation of learning, memory and plasticity in the brain. PhD students and post-docs from theoretical and/or experimental backgrounds (physics, math, neuroscience, engineering, etc.) are invited to apply. Familiarity with programming, dynamical systems, and/or computational neuroscience is desirable, but not necessary. We may also select a small number of exceptional undergraduate and Masters level students for the course, if they have sufficient background via courses and especially via project / hobby work related to these areas (write in your statement of interest & CV). The course will start with remedial tutorials on neuroscience / math / programming and then work upwards from sub-cellular electrical and chemical signaling in neurons, onward to micro-circuits and networks, all with an emphasis on learning, memory and plasticity.


## [School on Neurotechniques (DL: ??)](http://www.vassanellilab.eu/school-neurotechniques/school-neurotechniques-2016/)
*University of Padua – Italy ~ 15 – 19 February, **2016** *

Investigating information processing and identifying operational rules of brain neural circuits relies on the capability to selectively record and stimulate multiple neurons within a network. The toolbox of available techniques conceived to meet this need is rapidly expanding.The CSN School on Neurotechniques 2016 will offer an overview on advanced electrical- and light-based recording methods of neuronal excitability, focusing on those that are most relevant for the investigation of neural networks ‘in vitro’ and ‘in vivo’ and for application in neuroprosthetics. Methods and protocols on laboratory techniques and signal analysis  will be presented.



## [Frontier in Neurophotonics (DL: March 1, 2017)](https://neurophotonics.ca/frontiers-in-neurophotonics-summer-school)

Frontiers in Neurophotonics is an opportunity to meet fellow researchers and students from around the world, discuss and discover the latest advances in live cell optical imaging techniques put in perspective by experimental challenges in the field of neuroscience. The school will combine tutorials given by experts in photonics and neuroscience and hands-on experiments involving advanced optical approaches to measure, manipulate and follow molecular events in living neuronal cells.


## [Methods in Computational Neuroscience (DL:  March 7, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/methods-in-computational-neuroscience/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Chicago, US ~ July 30 – August 25, 2017*

Animals interact with a complex world, encountering a variety of challenges: They must gather data about the environment, discover useful structures in these data, store and recall information about past events, plan and guide actions, learn the consequences of these actions, etc. These are, in part, computational problems that are solved by networks of neurons, from roughly 100 cells in a small worm to 100 billion in humans. Methods in Computational Neuroscience introduces students to the computational and mathematical techniques that are used to address how the brain solves these problems at levels of neural organization ranging from single membrane channels to operations of the entire brain.

In each of the first three weeks, the course focuses on material at increasing levels of complexity (molecular/cellular, network, cognitive/behavioral), but always with an eye on these questions: Can we derive biologically plausible mechanisms that explain how nervous systems solve specific computational problems that arise in the laboratory or natural environment? Can these problems be decomposed into manageable pieces, and can we relate such mathematical decompositions to the observable properties of individual neurons and circuits? Can we identify the molecular mechanisms that provide the building blocks for these computations, as well as understand how the building blocks are organized into cells and circuits that perform useful functions?


## [Brains, Minds and Machines (DL: March 14, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/brains-minds-and-machines/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Chicago, US ~ August 13 – September 3, 2017*

The basis of intelligence – how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines – is arguably the greatest problem in science and technology. To solve it, we will need to understand how human intelligence emerges from computations in neural circuits, with rigor sufficient to reproduce similar intelligent behavior in machines. Success in this endeavor ultimately will enable us to understand ourselves better, to produce smarter machines, and perhaps even to make ourselves smarter. Today’s AI technologies, such as Watson and Siri, are impressive, but their domain specificity and reliance on vast numbers of labeled examples are obvious limitations; few view this as brain-like or human intelligence. The synergistic combination of cognitive science, neurobiology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science holds the promise to build much more robust and sophisticated algorithms implemented in intelligent machines. The goal of this course is to help produce a community of leaders that is equally knowledgeable in neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science and will lead the development of true biologically inspired AI.


## [Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School (DL:  March 5, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/methods-in-computational-neuroscience/)
*The Pike Lake, Transylvania, Romania ~ June 1 – 19, 2017*

TENSS concentrates top-level international expertise to teach a dozen students techniques and concepts in experimental systems neuroscience. We focus on modern optical and electrophysiological methods to study the connectivity and function of neuronal circuits. The course is designed to be intensive and highly interactive, including both lab sessions and theoretical lectures. Coursework will take place in a land of myth and legend, beyond large forests (Transylvania), on the shores of a picturesque natural reserve called Pike Lake. Applications are welcome from interested (and interesting) graduate students and postdocs.


## [Interacting with neural circuits (DL:  March 20, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/Interacting-with-neural-circuits/)
*Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Portugal ~ July 2 – 22, 2017*

Understanding how activity in neural circuits drives behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Making this link requires detailed information about the cell types and their connectivity, as well as the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in neural circuits in the intact brain during behaviour. Moreover, probing causal relationships between cellular and circuit-level processes and behaviour requires perturbation of specific elements of the circuit in a temporally and spatially precise manner. This course will highlight the new anatomical, optical, genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacogenetic approaches that are available for addressing these challenges. The faculty will discuss tool development through to their implementation in diverse model systems. Students will learn the potential and limitations of these techniques, allowing them to both design and interpret experiments correctly.


## [Advanced Techniques for Synapse Biology (DL:  March 20, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/ATSB2017/)
*Bordeaux Neurocampus, France ~ July 3 – 23, 2017*

Synapses are the major sites of information processing in the brain. The complexity of the synapse has been described in the past few years in great molecular details and major achievements have been gained in the understanding of networks of proteins occurring at the pre-synaptic cytomatrix and the postsynaptic compartment of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Synaptic dysfunction is a central aspect of many brain disorders (“synaptopathies”) and synapses are and potentially will be the main target of drugs for brain diseases. Synapses integrate complex signals through temporal and spatial codes and undergo rapid structural and functional changes (synaptic plasticity) that underlie the formation of engrams in the brain. Maladaptation of such processes can lead to aberrant perception, cognitive dysfunction or neurodegeneration. The study of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic function and -plasticity are the key to understanding of how the brain works and what goes wrong in brain disease. The advanced course will expose students to state-of-art techniques for molecular imaging and functional methodologies, through direct hands-on experiments.


## [CAJAL Course in Computational Neuroscience (DL:  March 20, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/CCCN2017/)
*Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Portugal ~ August 6 – 26, 2017*

Computational Neuroscience is a rapidly evolving field whose methods and techniques are critical for understanding and modeling the brain, and also for designing and interpreting experiments. Mathematical modeling is one of the few tools available to cut through the vast complexity of neurobiological systems and their many interacting elements.  This school teaches the central ideas, methods, and practice of modern computational neuroscience. Our mission with the course is to train the future generation of both computational and experimental neuroscientists, and to foster theory-driven experimental research. We provide a broad overview of theoretical techniques, from the introductory to the more advanced that are critical for understanding and modeling the brain, and for designing and interpreting experiments. A range of theoretical topics is covered, including cellular biophysics, neural network dynamics, neural coding and computation, statistical analysis of neural data, and behavioral and cognitive aspects of neural function. The course includes a strong hands-on and project-oriented component. Furthermore, the course will be held in Lisbon, Portugal with its many nearby sites and beaches offering ample opportunities to relax/explore during course breaks.


## [Summer School in Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience (DL:  April 11, 2016)](http://www.compneurosci.com/CoSMo/)
*University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA ~ July 31 – August 14, **2016***

This unique summer school focuses on computational techniques integrating the multi-disciplinary nature of sensory-motor neuroscience through combined empirical-theoretical teaching modules and makes use of databases of movement data (NSF CRCNS). Major breakthroughs in brain research have been achieved through computational models. The goal of the Summer School in Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience is to provide cross-disciplinary training in mathematical modelling techniques relevant to understanding brain function, dysfunction and treatment. In a unique approach bridging experimental research, clinical pathology and computer simulations, students will learn how to translate ideas and empirical findings into mathematical models. Students will gain a profound understanding of the brain’s working principles and diseases using advanced modelling techniques in hands-on simulations of models during tutored sessions by making use of data / model sharing. This summer school aims at propelling promising students into world-class researchers.



## [Methods in Computational Neuroscience (DL:  March 7, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/methods-in-computational-neuroscience/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Chicago, US ~ July 30 – August 25, 2017*

## [Methods in Computational Neuroscience (DL:  March 7, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/methods-in-computational-neuroscience/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Chicago, US ~ July 30 – August 25, 2017*

## [Ion channels in the brain in health and disease (DL:  ?)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/Ion-channels/)
*Bordeaux Neurocampus, France ~ September 4 – 22, 2017*

Ion channels play a major role in neuronal excitability. Diseases, termed channelopathies, are related to inherited or acquired dysfunctions of ion channels:  epilepsy, migraine, ataxia and deafness. Roughly 15% of known therapeutic drugs including anaesthetics, analgesics, anti-epileptics and anxiolytics have their primary action on ion channels, making them the second largest target class after G-protein coupled receptors. With the advent of a better understanding of cellular physiology and identification of the molecular components that constitute individual channel types and/or control their activity, rational molecular-based strategies to identify ion channel modulators are now within reach.

We are organizing a summer course to provide promising young investigators with a comprehensive introduction to state-of-the-art techniques in ion channel study,  including - but not limited - to genetics, electrophysiology, imaging, as well as structure-function and pathophysiological approaches. This 3-week course is a practical “hands-on” introduction to advanced methods in ion channel recording and analysis and will cover sufficient background such that all participants will be able to establish these techniques in their home laboratories.

# Data Analysis and Programming 

## [The Machine Learning Summer School (DL : Feburary 17 2017) ](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2017/index.html)
*Tübigen, Germany ~ June 19 - 30 2017*

The MLSS is a renowned venue for graduate students, researchers, and professionals. It offers an opportunity to learn about fundamental and advanced aspects of machine learning, data analysis and inference, from intellectual leaders of the field. We are very happy to announce a faculty of highly acclaimed speakers.

## [Advanced Scientific Programming in Python ](https://python.g-node.org/wiki/)
*Reading, UK ~ September 5-10, 2016*

Scientists spend more and more time writing, maintaining, and debugging software. While techniques for doing this efficiently have evolved, only few scientists have been trained to use them. As a result, instead of doing their research, they spend far too much time writing deficient code and reinventing the wheel. In this course we will present a selection of advanced programming techniques and best practices which are standard in the industry, but especially tailored to the needs of a programming scientist. Lectures are devised to be interactive and to give the students enough time to acquire direct hands-on experience with the materials. Students will work in pairs throughout the school and will team up to practice the newly learned skills in a real programming project — an entertaining computer game.
