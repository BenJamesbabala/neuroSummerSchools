#NeuroSummerSchools

This readme will contain a list of summer (and seasonnal) summer schools in neuroscience and related fields.

# Neuroscience 

## [VI Latin American School on Computational Neuroscience (DL : September)](http://www.nncn.de/en/study-training-options/Kurse)
*São Paulo, SP, Brazil ~ January 3 – 29 2016 (every even year)*

The sixth edition of the Latin American School on Computational Neuroscience – LASCON VI will be held in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The school will last for four  weeks and will cover topics as: biophysically detailed single neuron models; reduced and simplified neuron models; neural network models; synaptic plasticity and memory models; neural dynamics; spike train analysis; connectomics; stochastic models in neuroscience; and computational psychiatry. These models will be illustrated with the use of programs like NEURON, neuroConstruct, Matlab, NEST, Brian and the Virtual Brain. The faculty is composed of an international team of world-renowned researchers in the field of computational neuroscience.

## [Advanced Course on Neural Data Analysis (DL: 31 January)](https://portal.g-node.org/advanced-course-2017/doku.php)
*Juelich, Germany ~ March 26 - April 8 2017*

Techniques to record neuronal data from single neurons and population of neurons are rapidly improving. Meanwhile recordings are possible from hundreds of channels simultaneously while animals perform complex tasks. Thus also the analysis of such data becomes increasingly challenging. This advanced course aims at providing deeper insights in state-of-the-art questions in neuroscience, analysis approaches and how to formalize questions to neuronal data so they can be answered quantitatively.

# Data Analysis and Programming 
## [Advanced Scientific Programming in Python ](https://python.g-node.org/wiki/)
*Reading, UK ~ September 5-10, 2016*

Scientists spend more and more time writing, maintaining, and debugging software. While techniques for doing this efficiently have evolved, only few scientists have been trained to use them. As a result, instead of doing their research, they spend far too much time writing deficient code and reinventing the wheel. In this course we will present a selection of advanced programming techniques and best practices which are standard in the industry, but especially tailored to the needs of a programming scientist. Lectures are devised to be interactive and to give the students enough time to acquire direct hands-on experience with the materials. Students will work in pairs throughout the school and will team up to practice the newly learned skills in a real programming project — an entertaining computer game.


## [The Machine Learning Summer School (DL : Feburary 17 2017) ](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2017/index.html)
*Tübigen, Germany ~ June 19 - 30 2017*

The MLSS is a renowned venue for graduate students, researchers, and professionals. It offers an opportunity to learn about fundamental and advanced aspects of machine learning, data analysis and inference, from intellectual leaders of the field. We are very happy to announce a faculty of highly acclaimed speakers.
